# what's IAR and QT ?
IAR Systems is a leading global provider of embedded systems development tools and services. Founded in 1983, the company provides products and services at every stage of the design, development and testing of embedded systems, including integrated development environments (IDEs) with C/C++ compilers and debuggers, real-time operating systems and middleware, development kits, hardware emulators, and state machine modeling tools.

Qt [1] is a cross-platform C++ graphical user interface application development framework developed by Qt Company in 1991. It can be used to develop both GUI and non-GUI programs, such as console tools and servers. Qt is an object-oriented framework that uses special code-generating extensions (called the Meta Object Compiler (moc)) and macros that Qt is easy to extend and allows for truly component programming.

QT advantage:

1.Excellent cross-platform features:
***
Qt supports the following operating systems: Microsoft Windows 95/98, Microsoft Windows NT, Linux, Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX, Digital UNIX (OSF/1, Tru64), Irix, FreeBSD, BSD/OS, SCO, AIX, OS390, QNX, etc.
***
2.Object-oriented:
***
The good packaging mechanism of Qt makes Qt very modular, reusable, and very convenient for user development. Qt provides an alternative to callbacks with a security type called signals/slots, which makes it easy for the individual components to work together.
***
3.Rich APIs:
***
Qt includes more than 250 C++ classes, as well as template-based collections, serialization, file, I/O device, directory management, and date/time classes. It even includes regular expression processing.
